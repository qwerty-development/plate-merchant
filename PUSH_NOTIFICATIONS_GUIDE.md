### 2. Grant Permissions
You must grant notification permissions:

1. Open app
2. Close it completely (swipe away from recent apps)
3. Create a test booking from customer app
4. You should receive notification with sound!

**Test when app is in background:**
1. Open app
2. Press home button (don't close app)
3. Create a test booking
4. Notification appears at top with sound

**Test when app is open:**
1. Keep app on bookings screen
2. Create a test booking
3. Sound plays + notification + toast

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Files

### app.json
```json
{
  "android": {
    "permissions": [
      "android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS"
    ]
  },
  "plugins": [
    [
      "expo-notifications",
      {
        "icon": "./assets/images/icon.png",
        "color": "#792339",
        "sounds": [
          "./assets/notification/new_booking.wav"
        ]
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

### Hook: `use-push-notifications.ts`
- Handles notification permissions
- Registers device for push tokens
- Sets up notification handlers
- Creates Android notification channel
- Configures sound, vibration, priority

### Functions Available:
- `usePushNotifications()` - Main hook, returns push token
- `sendLocalNotification()` - Send notification immediately
- `cancelAllNotifications()` - Clear all notifications
- `setBadgeCount()` - Update app badge count

## üìä Badge Count Management

The badge on your app icon shows pending bookings count:
- **0**: No pending bookings (no badge)
- **1-99**: Shows exact number
- **100+**: Shows "99+"

Updates when:
- New booking arrives (+1)
- Accept booking (-1)
- Decline booking (-1)
- User cancels booking (-1)

## üîç Debugging

### Check if notifications are working:

1. **Console Logs**
Look for these messages:
```
üì± Push token: ExponentPushToken[...]
‚úÖ Push token obtained
‚úÖ Local notification sent
üíæ Saving push token to database...
```

2. **Test Notification**
Add test button to manually send notification:
```typescript
sendLocalNotification(
  'Test',
  'This is a test notification',
  { test: true }
);
```

3. **Check Permissions**
```typescript
const { status } = await Notifications.getPermissionsAsync();
console.log('Permission status:', status);
```

### Common Issues:

**No notifications received:**
- Check notification permissions in device settings
- Verify `new_booking.wav` exists in `assets/notification/`
- Check console for permission errors
- Make sure app has been opened at least once

**Sound not playing:**
- Check device volume
- Check notification sound settings
- Verify sound file is valid WAV format
- Android: Check notification channel settings

**Badge not updating:**
- iOS: Need proper permissions
- Android: Some launchers don't support badges
- Check console for badge update logs

## üöÄ Production Setup

### Before releasing:

1. **Test on Physical Device**
   - Emulators have limited notification support
   - Test on real Android device

2. **Test All Scenarios**
   - [ ] App closed
   - [ ] App in background
   - [ ] App in foreground
   - [ ] Sound plays
   - [ ] Badge updates
   - [ ] Tap notification opens app

3. **Firebase Setup (Optional)**
   For remote push notifications:
   - Set up Firebase project
   - Add `google-services.json`
   - Configure FCM server key
   - Send notifications from backend

## üìù Notes

### Local vs Remote Notifications:

**Current: Local Notifications**
- Sent by the app itself
- Work when app is in background/foreground
- Don't need internet to send
- Best for real-time responses

**Future: Remote Notifications**
- Sent from server/backend
- Work even if app is never opened
- Require FCM/APNs setup
- Better for true push from server

### Notification Behavior:

**Android:**
- Shows as heads-up notification
- Plays custom sound
- Vibrates
- Updates badge (on supported launchers)
- Can bypass Do Not Disturb

**iOS:**
- Shows as banner
- Plays custom sound (if added to project)
- Updates badge
- Respects silent mode (unless critical alert)

- ‚úÖ Sound plays when app is closed

- ‚úÖ Badge shows pending count
