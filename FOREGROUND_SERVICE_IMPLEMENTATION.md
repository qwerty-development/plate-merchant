# Android Foreground Service Implementation - Complete Guide

## üéØ What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented a **proper Android Foreground Service** using Notifee that will keep your restaurant tablet app alive 24/7, even when:
- The tablet screen is off
- The app is in the background
- Android tries to conserve battery
- The device enters Doze mode

### Why This Matters
Your previous implementation only created a persistent notification, which **did not** keep the app process alive. Android would kill the app when backgrounded, losing the Supabase realtime connection. This new implementation creates a **true foreground service** that prevents Android from killing the app.

---

## üì¶ What Was Changed

### 1. **New Package Installed**
- **@notifee/react-native** (v9.1.8) - Industry-standard library for Android foreground services
- **expo-intent-launcher** - For opening battery optimization settings

### 2. **New Files Created**

#### `plugins/withNotifee.js`
- Expo config plugin that automatically configures Android manifest
- Adds required permissions (FOREGROUND_SERVICE, FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC, etc.)
- Registers Notifee's foreground service in the Android manifest
- Adds special use property for Android 14+ compliance

#### `hooks/use-notifee-foreground-service.ts`
- Replaces the old `useForegroundService` hook
- Creates a **real** Android foreground service
- Shows a persistent notification (required by Android)
- Keeps the app process alive in the background
- Updates notification with pending booking count

#### `hooks/use-battery-optimization.ts`
- Detects battery optimization status
- Requests battery optimization exemption
- Opens Android settings directly
- Shows detailed setup guide for restaurant staff

#### Updated: `app/(tabs)/bookings.tsx`
- Integrated new Notifee foreground service
- Added battery optimization prompts
- Updates service notification with pending count
- Shows battery alert indicator in UI

#### Updated: `app.json`
- Added `./plugins/withNotifee.js` to plugins array

## üöÄ Next Steps - REQUIRED

Since this app uses **Notifee**, which is a native module, you **MUST** create a new development build. The Expo Go app will NOT work.

### Step 1: Install EAS CLI (if not already installed)
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

### Step 2: Build a Development Build for Android
```bash
# Build for Android device/emulator
eas build --profile development --platform android

# OR, to build locally (faster, requires Android Studio):
eas build --profile development --platform android --local
```

### Step 3: Install the Development Build
After the build completes:
1. Download the APK from the EAS build page
2. Install it on your Samsung tablet
3. OR scan the QR code to download directly on the device

### Step 4: Start the Development Server
```bash
npx expo start --dev-client
```

### Step 5: Configure the Tablet for 24/7 Operation

#### A. Battery Optimization (CRITICAL)
1. Open Android Settings
2. Go to Apps ‚Üí Plate Merchant
3. Go to Battery
4. Select **"Unrestricted"** or **"Don't optimize"**
5. Enable **"Background activity"**

The app will prompt the user to do this automatically on first launch.

#### B. Keep Screen Awake (Optional but Recommended)
1. In Developer Options: Enable "Stay awake" when charging
2. OR use the tablet's display settings to set a long timeout

#### C. Prevent App Closure
1. Open Recent Apps
2. Find Plate Merchant
3. Long press the app card
4. Tap the lock icon (if available)

#### D. Auto-Start After Reboot
1. In Android Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Plate Merchant
2. Enable "Auto-start" or "Auto-launch" (varies by manufacturer)
3. This ensures the app starts when the tablet reboots

## üîß How It Works

### The Flow:

1. **App Launches** ‚Üí Foreground service starts automatically
2. **Notifee creates persistent notification** ‚Üí Shows "Plate Merchant Active"
3. **Android keeps app process alive** ‚Üí Because of the foreground service
4. **Supabase realtime connection stays alive** ‚Üí No disconnections
5. **New booking arrives** ‚Üí App immediately plays sound
6. **Service notification updates** ‚Üí Shows pending booking count

### Key Components:

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: Service not starting
**Solution:**
- Make sure you built a development build (not using Expo Go)
- Check logs: `npx expo start --dev-client` and look for Notifee errors
- Verify the config plugin is in app.json

### Problem: App still getting killed
**Solution:**
- Verify battery optimization is disabled
- Some manufacturers (Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei) have extra restrictions
- Check Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Plate Merchant ‚Üí Battery
- Enable "Background activity"
- Disable "Put app to sleep"

### Problem: Sound not playing
**Solution:**
- Check if "Do Not Disturb" is enabled on the tablet

## üîê Permissions Required

The config plugin automatically adds these permissions to AndroidManifest.xml:

- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` - Required for foreground services
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC` - Specifies service type
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE` - For Android 14+ compliance
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - For showing notifications
- `WAKE_LOCK` - Keeps device awake when needed
- `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` - For critical booking alerts
- `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` - To request exemption

---

## üìù Important Notes

### 1. Development Build Required
You **MUST** use a development build. Expo Go will NOT work with Notifee.

### 2. Android Only
This implementation is Android-only (as requested). iOS doesn't need foreground services for this use case.

### 3. Tablet Setup
Each Samsung tablet needs to be configured with:
- Battery optimization disabled
- Auto-start enabled
- App locked in recent apps

### 4. Production Build
When ready for production:
```bash
eas build --profile production --platform android
```

### 5. Testing in Development
The foreground service works in development builds. You don't need to wait for production.

## üéØ Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:

‚úÖ App stays alive 24/7 with screen off
‚úÖ Sound plays immediately when booking arrives
‚úÖ No disconnections from Supabase
‚úÖ Works after leaving app idle for hours/days
‚úÖ Survives device Doze mode
‚úÖ Continues after backgrounding
‚úÖ Service notification updates with pending count

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs: `npx expo start --dev-client`
2. Look for Notifee errors or warnings
3. Verify battery optimization is disabled
4. Test the realtime connection (WiFi indicator)
5. Check Android version (must be 5.0+, ideally 8.0+)
